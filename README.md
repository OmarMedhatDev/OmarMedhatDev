## Projects  

### 🔠 [Multimodal Translation](https://github.com/OmarMedhatDev/Multimodal-Translation-Project-DEPI)  
Developed advanced machine learning solutions for language translation, chatbot interactions, and OCR. Key contributions include:  
- **Machine Translation:** Built English-to-Arabic translation models using Seq2Seq and LSTM architectures, leveraging MarianMT for improved accuracy.  
- **Conversational AI:** Designed a chatbot with NLP techniques, incorporating sequence-to-sequence models and attention mechanisms for responsive interaction.  
- **OCR System:** Implemented an optical character recognition pipeline using CNNs for character identification and computer vision for post-processing.  

### 🏨 [Hotel Booking Demand Prediction](https://github.com/OmarMedhatDev/DNN-Hotel-Booking)  
Designed a machine learning pipeline to analyze and predict hotel booking cancellations. Key steps included:  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and engineered features like total nights and total guests. Identified and removed outliers to enhance data quality.  
- **Feature Scaling:** Applied standard scaling for improved model performance and stability.  
- **Model Training:** Trained a neural network using Keras with layers optimized for binary classification, achieving 92% accuracy with early stopping to prevent overfitting.
